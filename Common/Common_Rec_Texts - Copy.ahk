Records of these inspections should be maintained on file.


;----------------- Weekly Fire Pump Inspection ----------------------------------

:*:weeklypumpt::Conduct weekly documented fire protection pump tests via pressure drop.

:*:weeklypumpr::Automatic starting should be tested by simulating a drop in system pressure at the fire pump control panel. This is done by releasing pressure in the line leading to the controller's pressure sensor.{Enter}At each test, checks should be made of the operation of the priming devices, the temperature and tightness of the glands, the readings of the suction and discharge gauges, and the condition of the suction supply. Check actual start and stop pressures against pressure switch settings every time the fire pump unit is started.'

	As the world's largest soda ash mine and manufacturing plant, this facility is a very valuable asset for Genesis Alkali Holdings.
	
	From the fire and natural hazards (F&NH) perspective, ignitable liquids at the ELDM plant remain one of the largest exposures here. Their ability to spread over a large area and their high heat of combustion make them difficult to extinguish, which result in large fires with considerable smoke and water damage. Improving the storage of ignitable liquids at the ELDM plant, as outlined in this report, would help reduce the likelihood of a severe ignitable liquid fire.
	
	From the boiler and machinery (B&M) perspective, the primary hazard is failure of the electrical infrastructure - specifically the medium voltage switchgear batteries. The battery testing recommendation was completed and the issues were identified and corrected. The next step is to improve the asset management by monitoring and controlling the temperature to as close to 77°F as practical, and have a remote alarm to a constantly attended location. 
	
	A robust asset integrity strategy coupled with thorough documentation, is necessary for trending, predicting, outage planning, and/or supporting an effective asset management program.
	
	Management and maintenance personnel have been working diligently to improve the asset integrity programs, and should be commended for their ongoing efforts in this area. Any gaps in maintenance routines are identified and reviewed for implementation.
	
	In addition to the formal recommendations made, additional comments have been provided that also represent industry best practices, and should be completed.

; From B&M perspective, the primary exposure is failure of mechanical rotating equipment. The gears that turn these large kilns and mills can take up to 18 months to receive once ordered. Current production rates preclude the possibility of long-term makeup by the other production equipment. The lack of nondestructive examination/testing (NDE/T) program, and/or spare ring gear segments,  is a cause for concern and brings this risk to the forefront. A formal, documented, equipment contingency plan (ECP) exists; however, upon further review, the vendor (Metso) was unable to find the drawings/specifications for the bull gears. This is critical information that can cause significant delay, should be maintained on-file, and included in the ECP.

; The secondary minor exposure is failure of the electrical infrastructure. Due to a FM Global standards change based on loss history and industry changes, annual partial discharge (PD) online surveys on 4 kV switchgear/circuit breakers are now being recommended versus previous "best practice" guidance.

; ;----------------------- Quarterly Waterflow Alarm Title ----------------------------

; :*:qwft::Conduct quarterly, documented, waterflow alarm testing.

; :*:qwfr::Waterflow alarms should be tested by opening the inspectors test valves to flow water through the sprinkler system. For wet-pipe systems, use the inspectorâ€™s test connection at the extreme end of the system. For dry-pipe systems, use the hydraulic test connections at the dry-pipe valve. The waterflow alarm should activate within 90 seconds of the initial waterflow. Testing should be done only by well-trained personnel or by an inspection service to avoid unnecessary local disturbances and response by the public fire department. Following the test, the alarm monitoring company should be contacted to confirm that all test signals are received. Records of all testing should be retained for review.


; ;------------------ Monthly Physical Valve Inspection ---------------------------------

; :*:mvit::Conduct monthly, documented, physical inspections of post-indicator valves.

; :*:mvir::Monthly physical testing of post-indicator valves and wall post-indicator valves verifies that valves are open and that indicating mechanisms are properly aligned with the unitâ€™s window. Records of these inspections should be maintained on file.{Enter}Physically inspecting a valve includes:{Enter}Unlocking the valve.{Enter}Turning the hand-wheel or wrench in the fully open position direction.{Enter}Turning in the closed direction two or three turns to ensure operable condition.{Enter}Returning the valve to the full open position (feeling the spring in the shaft).{Enter}Backing off approximately one-quarter turn to relieve the strain.{Enter}Relocking the valve.

; :*:mchanger::Get FM Global engineering involved during the initial planning stages (the earlier the better) for any new process or process changes, construction, roofing or roof repairs, changes in fire protection, installation of gas-fired equipment or occupancy changes.  Ideally, design documents should be reviewed early in project planning and no later than the â€˜Schematicsâ€™ design phase, before the project scope and budget are developed. Early involvement by FM Global will allow alternative solutions or recommendations to be considered before budget, scope or schedule changes are required.

; ;---------------------------- Lock Sprinkler Valves ----------------------------------------

; :*:lvt::Lock all fire sprinkler control valves in the wide-open position.

; :*:lvr::All sprinkler control valves larger than 1.5 in. should be locked in the fully open position with unbreakable locks and chains. Keys for the locks should be distributed to the personnel directly responsible for fire protection. During the risk evaluation the following valves were found unlocked.

; ;-------------------------- Install AS Sprinkler Protection --------------------------------

; :*:installast::Install automatic sprinkler protection in

; :*:installasr::Sprinkler protection should be installed in accordance with FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet 2-0, Installation Guidelines for Automatic Sprinklers and FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet 2-8, Earthquake Protection for Water-Based Fire Protection Systems.{Enter}Before completing any such upgrade, FM Global should be contacted to review details of the proposed plans and coordinate the design with the contractor.

; ;------------------------------ Annual Infrared Inspection -----------------------------------

; :*:irt::Perform infrared thermographic surveys on all electrical equipment annually.

; :*:irr::Infrared surveys of electrical equipment should be done only by a qualified contractor or employee.

; Capacitance (Internal Ohmic) Testing: (see Note 1)
; Section 2.5.2 and Table 1: Capacitance testing, maintenance schedule, and other useful information.
; - Capacitance, internal ohmic, internal resistance, and internal impedance, are common terms that are synonymous.
; - This requires a specific type of testing equipment, and cannot be done with a standard multimeter; a multimeter will provide resistance readings, but this is not the same as internal resistance.

; Capacity (Performance or Discharge) Testing: (see Note 2)
; Section 2.5.2.4: Periodicity of capacity testing based on battery type, and other useful information.

; Failure Modes:
; Section 3.3.3 and Table 2: Provides pictures and technical detail on major failure modes of flooded/vented lead acid (VLA) batteries (e.g., sulfating).

; Alternatives:
; - Note 1: If all of Section 2.3.6.2 (as applicable) parameters are monitored, annual capacitance (internal ohmic) testing is acceptable. The continuously monitored parameters should match Table 1; whatever is not continuously monitored, perform at regular recommended periodicity.  
; - Note 2: If all of Table 1, including internal ohmic, is performed, and some additional conditions met (detailed below), it is acceptable not to perform capacity (performance or discharge) testing, due to the battery's application.
; - Must meet all of the following conditions: Baseline values are recorded at the recommended intervals; the same testing equipment is utilized throughout battery life; a prescriptive failing/failed battery replacement/capacity testing program is developed, and followed; the batteries do not support any loads other than the medium voltage switchgear, and its associated protective features.
